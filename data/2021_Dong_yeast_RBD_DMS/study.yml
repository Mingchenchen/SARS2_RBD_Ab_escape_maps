notes: "Data taken from Supplementary Data Table 1, which is mirrored here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbloomlab/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_MAP_AZ_Abs/main/results/supp_data/AZ_cocktail_raw_data.csv. Note that we have used the AstraZeneca antibody names: AZD8895 = COV2-2196, AZD1061 = COV2-2130, and AZD7442 = COV2-2196 + COV2-2130, and have renamed the data accordingly from that in the table above."
